# Approach Evaluation

## Purpose

Systematically compare multiple candidate approaches to a problem, evaluating each against trade-offs, feasibility, constraints, and project goals. Recommend the approach best suited to the situation.

## When to Use

- When multiple valid approaches exist and a decision must be made.
- When trade-offs between speed, quality, cost, or risk need to be weighed.
- When constraints (time, team skill, tooling, architecture) eliminate some approaches.
- Before committing to an implementation strategy.

## Workflow

1. **Enumerate approaches.**
   - Identify all viable candidate approaches, not just the obvious one.
   - Include approaches that differ meaningfully in strategy or effort.
   - Discard only those that are clearly infeasible, and note why.

2. **Define evaluation criteria.**
   - Establish the dimensions of comparison relevant to this task.
   - Consider effort, risk, maintainability, scalability, and fit with existing patterns.
   - Ensure the criteria reflect the actual constraints and goals.

3. **Score each approach.**
   - Evaluate each candidate consistently against every criterion.
   - Base scores on evidence and reasoning, not first impressions.
   - Record where an approach clearly excels or falls short.

4. **Identify trade-offs.**
   - Make explicit what each approach gains and what it sacrifices.
   - Surface hidden costs such as complexity, lock-in, or maintenance burden.
   - Compare trade-offs against the priorities that matter most here.

5. **Recommend.**
   - Select the approach best aligned with constraints and goals.
   - Justify the recommendation against the criteria and trade-offs.
   - State the conditions under which a different approach would be preferred.

## Quality Criteria

- All viable approaches are considered, not just the first that comes to mind.
- Evaluation criteria are explicit and relevant to the task.
- Trade-offs are concrete and specific.
- The recommendation is justified, not asserted.

## Anti-Patterns

- **False dichotomy**: Presenting only two options when more exist.
- **Criteria mismatch**: Evaluating against criteria irrelevant to the actual task.
- **Unjustified recommendation**: Picking an approach without explaining why.
- **Ignoring constraints**: Recommending an approach that violates known constraints.
