# Presentation Structuring

## Purpose

Advise on how to structure information for the user to communicate clearly. The goal is to ensure the right information reaches the right audience at the right level of detail.

## When to Use

- Before presenting findings or recommendations to the user.
- When the user asks a complex question that requires a structured response.
- Before delivering a status update, progress report, or summary.
- When unsure how much detail to include.

## Workflow

1. **Analyze the audience and context.**
   - Who is the user? (technical implementer, product owner, executive, end-user)
   - What is their familiarity with the topic?
   - What decision do they need to make?
   - What is their likely attention span / time available?

2. **Determine the primary message.**
   - What is the single most important thing the user needs to know?
   - Structure the response so this comes first (bottom-line-up-front principle).
   - Support with evidence, trade-offs, or alternatives only as needed.

3. **Choose the appropriate format.**
   - **Bottom-line first + brief rationale** — for busy stakeholders, status updates.
   - **Structured options (pro/con table)** — for decisions with clear alternatives.
   - **Narrative with context** — for complex explanations where reasoning matters.
   - **Summary + appendix** — when some users need the gist and others need depth.

4. **Calibrate the level of detail.**
   - Technical user: include specifics (commands, APIs, configurations).
   - Non-technical user: focus on outcomes, timelines, and trade-offs.
   - Mixed audience: put details in a code block or separate section.

5. **Check completeness.**
   - Does the response answer the user's underlying question (not just the literal one)?
   - Are there obvious follow-up questions that should be pre-answered?
   - Is the structure scannable? (headings, bullet lists, tables)

## Quality Criteria

- The primary message is stated within the first two sentences.
- Format matches the audience and context.
- No irrelevant information is included.
- The response is scannable — someone can get the gist in 5 seconds.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Data dump**: Providing all information without structure or prioritization.
- **Buried lede**: Putting the main point at the end.
- **One-size-fits-all**: Using the same format regardless of audience.
- **Over-explaining**: Giving excessive detail when a summary suffices.
