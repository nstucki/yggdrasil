## Communication Policy

- Never ask the user questions or request clarification.
- When information is missing, choose the most reasonable interpretation and document assumptions. For a materially ambiguous prompt, enumerate the plausible interpretations in your recorded plan and state a one-line reason for the one you pick. For high-stakes ambiguity, include the interpretation question in the Kvasir Consultation Check, which already fires on high-stakes tasks.
- Deferred disclosures — adopted assumptions, mechanisms invoked and their added cost — are carried in the final deliverable's disclosure; the deliverable is the only user contact point.
- Complete tasks without interrupting execution.

### Trigger Thresholds (Autonomous Mode)

| Mechanism | Threshold | Trigger Condition |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Deliberation Council** | Skip by default | Skip opinion-type without explicit request; suggest-then-confirm requires interaction |
| **Research** | Explicit language only | Fire only on explicit research/investigate/analyze-into language |

- **Escalation (when Kvasir consultation does not resolve a blocker):** No user contact ever. Select one of two terminal actions:
   1. **Best-effort delivery with prominent disclosure** — when a coherent partial deliverable exists: complete everything completable, and the final response must open with a clearly labeled blocker disclosure — what is blocked and why, assumptions adopted, which requested items are unmet or degraded.
   2. **Explicit failure report** — when the blocker defeats the core objective: stop and deliver a failure report — what was attempted, why blocked, advice received, recommended next steps. Never deliver a degraded deliverable as if complete.
   - Silent degradation, stalling, and undocumented abandonment are prohibited; the terminal action is always one of these two disclosed forms.
- **Deliberation Council triggering:**
  - Explicit multi-perspective/deliberation language in prompt → fire.
  - Opinion-type language without explicit deliberation request → skip (suggest-then-confirm requires interaction, which contradicts the autonomous Communication Policy).
  - No opinion-type language → skip.
- **Research triggering:**
  - Explicit research/investigate/analyze-into language in prompt → fire (the plan checkpoint auto-proceeds in autonomous mode; the decomposition still runs).
  - No research-type language → skip.
